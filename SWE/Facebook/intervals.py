an interval two numbers that represent the space between those numbers.
A list of intervals must be non-intersecting and in ascended order. 
write:
1) a method that that validates if a given list of intervals satisfies those conditions
2) a method that merges two lists of intervals so that they become legal lists.
   if there is overlap between two intervals, merge them into one interval.
