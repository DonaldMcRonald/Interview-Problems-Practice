# QUESTION 1
# Write a function to flatten a nested list. For example,
# flatten([1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6, 7], 8], 9, 0]) => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]

# QUESTION 2
# Given a string of letters between a-z, write a function that
# returns an encoded string that contains the count of consecutive
# letters. For example, "aaaaaaa" would encoded as "seven a's",
# thus returning "7a". 
 
# The string "aabbba" would be encoded as "2a3b1a".
