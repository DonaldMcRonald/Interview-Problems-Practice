"""
Given an unordered list/array as input, order it in the following fashion:

Ordinarily when you sort a list, every sequential value, is either greater or
less than the previous value. Implement a sort that alternates this ie:

    The 2nd number has to be greater than the 1st
    The 3rd number has to be less    than the 2nd
    The 4th number has to be greater than the 3rd
    and so on...

ex: [3,4,8,2,1,7,5,6,9] -> [1,3,2,5,4,7,6,9,8]

(there are many solutions to this)
