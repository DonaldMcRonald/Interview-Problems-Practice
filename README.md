# Compilation of Interview Problems!

This repository is a compiled list of interview problems that people have encountered in the past.

**Organization**

* The root directory contains directories that correspond to specific positions.  

*  Within each position directory, theres numerous directories, each of which are named after the company they represent.

* Within those are the problems.

**Please follow the following rules if you wish to contribute:**

1. Please do not add any problems you are not allowed to disclose (aka you signed an NDA with that company).  

2. Please create two separate files, one with the question, and the other with the solution (if you have it). This way people can have a chance of actually attempting the problems w/o seeing the solution immediately.

3. Please add your problem to the proper directory that corresponds with the company that gave you this problem. This will make it easier for people to prep for specific companies interviews and organize all the problems.

4. If a directory does not exist for the company who gave you this problem, please create a directory with that companies name, and add the problem to that directory.

Thank you for contributing and gl on your interviews **:)**
